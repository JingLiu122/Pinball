# PinballGame
A simple pinball game project that powered by Unreal Engine 4. The project is programmed entirely in Blueprint, that's included: a pinball and plunger, flippers, bumpers, a leaderboard and scoring system, a main menu interface, etc.; all were used to add functionalities on top of the gameplay. For example, the scoring system keeps tracking and displaying the scores on the HUD when each time the pinball collided with the bumpers and slingshots (objects to get points). When the game ends (given 3 lives), the system can be determined the highest score value by dropping the lowest one on the struct container, and then let the player enter that high score value on the leaderboard. Finally, the leaderboard will display the saved top 5 high score values on the main menu. 

## Getting Started
